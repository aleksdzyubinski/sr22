Format of the contract
i.        These terms of sale apply to all goods supplied by XBMC Solutions LTD, whose registered office is at 160 London Road, Barking, IG11 8BB (the Supplier).

ii.        No contract exists between you and the Supplier for the sale of any goods until the Supplier has received and accepted your order and the Supplier has received payment in full (in cleared funds). Once the Supplier does so, there is a binding legal contract between us.

iii.        By way of clarification, an acknowledgement of your order will be sent to you via e-mail when you place your order, but acceptance of your offer to buy the goods will not take place until after your payment is taken and you receive your acceptance e-mail. It is at this point that a binding legal contract is created and any contract is subject to these Terms and Conditions.

iv.        The contract is subject to your right of cancellation (see below).

v.        The Supplier may change these terms of sale without notice to you in relation to future sales.

vi.        To order goods through the DroidBOX website you must be at least 18 years of age. We will treat each order for goods as an offer by you to purchase the goods subject to these terms and conditions.

vii.        DroidBOX gives no assurance as to the mutual compatibility of components sold on any single invoice. It is the responsibility of the buyer to ensure that the goods purchased are suitable for the purpose intended. Advice sought by the customer from the Company in this respect may be given but cannot be relied upon by the customer or guaranteed by the Company unless the Company has access to the working system and the ability to carry out a full inspection of any software or operating system.

viii.        Except as may be implied by law where the buyer is dealing as a consumer, in event of any breach of these Conditions by the Company the remedies of the buyer shall be limited to damages which shall in no circumstances exceed the price of the goods and the Company shall under no circumstances be liable for any indirect, incidental or consequential damages.

ix.        These terms and conditions are subject only to UK law.

Description and price of the goods
i.        The description and price of the goods you order will be as shown on the Supplier's website at the time you place your order.

ii.        The goods are subject to availability. If on receipt of your order the goods you have ordered are not available in stock, the Supplier will inform you as soon as possible and refund or re-credit you for any sum that has been paid by you or debited from your credit card for the goods.

iii.        Every effort is made to ensure that prices shown on the Supplier's website are accurate at the time you place your order. If an error is found, the Supplier will inform you as soon as possible and offer you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price, or cancelling your order. If the Supplier does not receive an order confirmation within 14 days of informing you of the error, the order will be cancelled automatically. If you cancel the order, or if the order is cancelled automatically due to the expiry of the 14 day period, the Supplier will refund or re-credit you for any sum that has been paid by you or debited from your credit card for the goods.

iv.        In addition to the price, you may be required to pay a delivery charge for the goods.

Payment
i.        Payment for the goods and delivery charges can be made by any method shown on the Supplier's website at the time you place your order. Payment shall be due before the delivery date, except where agreed otherwise by the Supplier and time for payment shall be a fundamental term of this agreement, breach of which shall entitle the Supplier to terminate the contract immediately.

ii.        There will be no delivery until cleared funds are received , except in the case of supplies of goods provided on credit terms.

iii.        Payments shall be made by you without any deduction whatsoever unless you have a valid court order requiring an amount equal to such deduction to be paid by the Supplier to you.

iv.        Where the Supplier agrees to provide goods on credit terms, the standard payment terms shall be 30 days from the date of invoice. In the event that payment is not made by the due date the Supplier reserves the right to charge interest from the date of invoice at 8% per annum, compounded monthly.

v.        The Company reserves the right to levy charges for any of the following services: Inspection of any piece of computer equipment and installation / replacement of either software or hardware - Use of credit / debit cards or rapid cheque clearance facilities, Diagnosis and testing of any problems encountered with any piece of hardware or software, Recovery of any hardware or software problems and backup of any data when requested by the customer.

Delivery
i.        The goods you order will be delivered to the address you give when you place your order, except that some deliveries are not made outside the United Kingdom.

ii.        Orders placed before 3.00 pm on a working day will be processed that day and will be delivered as per the requested delivery option provided no additional security checks are required and all stock items are available. (A working day is any day other than weekends and bank or other public holidays.)

iii.        If delivery cannot be made to your address for reasons under the Supplier's control the Supplier will inform you as soon as possible.

iv.        If you deliberately fail to take delivery of the goods (otherwise than by reason of circumstances under control of the Supplier) then without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to the Supplier , the Supplier may:

§  store the goods until actual delivery and charge you for reasonable costs (including insurance) of storage; or

§  sell the goods at the best readily obtainable price and (after deducting all reasonable storage and selling expenses) account to you for any excess over the price you agreed to pay for the goods or charge you for any shortfall below the price you agreed to pay for the goods.

v.        If you fail to take delivery because you have cancelled your contract under the Distance Selling Regulations the Supplier shall refund or re-credit you within 30 days for any sum that has been paid by you or debited from your credit card for the goods. On exercising your right to cancel you shall be required to return the goods to the Supplier. Should you fail to return the goods, the Supplier reserves the right to deduct any direct costs incurred by the Supplier in retrieving the goods as a result of such failure.

vi.        The Company will not accept liability for goods lost in transit unless we are notified within 5 days from the expected delivery date. This will be the date advised on the Customers automated despatch note which is emailed to the Customer once the items have left our warehouse.

vii.        Should you require the goods to be redirected to another address after the goods have been dispatched you may be required to pay an additional postage charge.

viii.        Every effort will be made to deliver the goods as soon as possible after your order has been accepted. However, the Supplier will not be liable for any loss or damage suffered by you through reasonable or unavoidable delay in delivery. In this case, the Supplier will inform you as soon as possible.

ix.        Upon receipt of your order you will be asked to sign for the goods received in good condition. If the package does not appear to be in good condition then please refuse the delivery. If you are unable to check the contents of your delivery at the point of delivery then please sign for the parcel as "UNCHECKED". Failure to do so may affect any warranty claims that you make thereafter.

x.        Whilst every effort shall be made to keep any delivery date, time of delivery shall not be of the essence. The Company shall not be liable for any consequential loss incurred by the buyer or any other person or company arising directly or indirectly out of any failure to meet any estimated delivery date.

xi.        Unless otherwise agreed the Company may deliver by instalments and in such case each instalment shall be treated as a separate contract and any delay, default or non-delivery in respect of any instalment by the Company shall not entitle the buyer to cancel the remainder of the Contract.

xii.        Delivery charges are calculated by weight and number of packages being sent. There will also be additional delivery charges for offshore destinations such as Ireland.

xiii.        Any refused deliveries will be returned to the supplier. Upon receipt of the goods with the supplier a refund will be issued minus 10% of the value of the order to cover administration costs.

xiv.        We will do our best to deliver your order on next working day. However we can't be responsible for any delays caused by the shipper.
